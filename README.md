# NumPy (Numerical Python)

## 📌 Overview
This module introduces **NumPy**, the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. I learned how to work with N-dimensional arrays to perform complex mathematical operations efficiently, far surpassing the capabilities of standard Python lists.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1. Introduction & Basics
* **Installation:** Setting up the NumPy environment.
* **Lists vs. Arrays:** Understanding why NumPy arrays are faster and more memory-efficient than Python lists.
* **Data Types:** Exploring specific NumPy types (e.g., `int64`, `float32`) for optimized storage.

### 2. Array Creation & Structure
* **Creating Arrays:**
  * From standard Python Lists.
  * Using built-in methods (e.g., `np.zeros()`, `np.arange()`, `np.linspace()`).
* **Properties:** Checking `shape`, `size`, and `dtype`.
* **Multi-dimensional Arrays:** Working with Axes, Matrix structures, and 3D Arrays.

### 3. Array Manipulation
* **Indexing & Slicing:** Accessing specific data points and subarrays.
* **Reshaping:** Changing the dimensions of data without changing the data itself.
* **Copy vs. View:** Understanding memory management when slicing arrays (Deep copy vs. Shallow reference).

### 4. Advanced Operations
* **Vectorization:** Performing operations on entire arrays without loops (Simultaneous processing).
* **Broadcasting:** Performing arithmetic on arrays of different shapes.
* **Normalization:** Scaling vectors to a standard range.

### 5. Mathematics & Statistics
* **Aggregates:** Calculating `sum`, `min`, `max`.
* **Statistics:** Computing Mean, Median, and Standard Deviation.
